Reasearch report for my Multivariable Calculus class.

Topic selected was canny edge detection and i created my own implementation of it for testing
The report and code are all available here

The Canny edge detection algorithm is composed of 6 steps:

1. Gray Scale conversion
2. Noise reduction
3. Gradient calculation
4. Non-maximum suppression
5. Double threshold
6. Edge Tracking by Hysteresis
